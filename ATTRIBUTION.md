The world for this project is inspired by the apartment from the TV show [The Big Bang Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory)

The world [file](my_robot/worlds/bbt.world) itself is modeled after this [sketch](https://squareclockdata.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/The-Big-Bang-Theory-sheldon-leonard-appartement.jpg) taken from [here](https://home.by.me/blog/the-big-bang-theory-apartment-in-3d)

The robot design(R2-D2) is closely modeled after this official ROS [tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch) on the ROS wiki.
